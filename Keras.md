## üß† What is Keras?

**Keras** is an open-source **deep learning** library written in Python. It provides a **high-level API** to build and train **neural networks** easily.

Originally, Keras was built as a wrapper around low-level libraries like:

* TensorFlow
* Theano
* Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)

Today, Keras is officially a part of **TensorFlow** and is known as **TensorFlow Keras**.

## ‚úÖ Why Use Keras?

Keras is popular because it is:

* **Beginner-friendly** and easy to learn
* **Modular** ‚Äì everything (layers, models, optimizers) is separate and reusable
* **Fast prototyping** ‚Äì quickly try ideas
* **Supports multiple backends** (originally), but now mainly TensorFlow
* **Runs on CPU and GPU**

## üîß Core Components of Keras

### 1. **Models**

A model in Keras is a container for your neural network.

There are two main ways to build models:

* **Sequential API**: Simple, layer-by-layer model.
* **Functional API**: For complex models (like models with multiple inputs/outputs or shared layers).

#### Example: Sequential Model

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```

### 2. **Layers**

Each layer processes data and passes it to the next one. Common layers include:

* `Dense`: Fully connected layer
* `Conv2D`: Convolutional layer (used in image processing)
* `LSTM`: Recurrent layer (used for sequences like text)
* `Dropout`: Regularization to prevent overfitting
* `Flatten`, `MaxPooling2D`, etc.

### 3. **Activation Functions**

They decide how outputs are transformed. Common functions:

* `relu`
* `sigmoid`
* `softmax`
* `tanh`

### 4. **Loss Functions**

Used to measure how well the model is doing.
Examples:

* `mean_squared_error`
* `binary_crossentropy` (for binary classification)
* `categorical_crossentropy` (for multi-class classification)

### 5. **Optimizers**

These help the model learn by adjusting weights:

* `SGD` (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
* `Adam` (very commonly used)
* `RMSprop`
* `Adagrad`

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training a Model

After building the model, you must **compile** it and then **train** it:

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

* `compile()`: Sets optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
* `fit()`: Trains the model on your data for a number of epochs.

---

## üìä Evaluating and Predicting

To evaluate how well your model works:

```python
model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
```

To make predictions:

```python
predictions = model.predict(X_new)
```

---

## üåç Real-World Uses of Keras

Keras is used in many areas of machine learning, including:

* **Image classification** (e.g. cats vs dogs)
* **Text processing / NLP** (e.g. sentiment analysis)
* **Time series prediction**
* **Recommender systems**
* **Generative models** (e.g. GANs)

## üß± Keras with TensorFlow

Modern Keras is built into TensorFlow:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
```

You don‚Äôt need to install Keras separately if you have TensorFlow installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

## üí° Summary: How Keras Works (Simple Steps)

1. **Import Keras** and required modules.
2. **Create a model** (Sequential or Functional).
3. **Add layers** to the model.
4. **Compile** the model (set optimizer, loss, metrics).
5. **Train** the model with data (`fit()`).
6. **Evaluate** performance.
7. **Make predictions**.

## üß™ Example: Build a Simple Model for Classification

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Step 1: Define model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

# Step 2: Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Step 3: Train model (X_train and y_train must be ready)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=16)

# Step 4: Evaluate
model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
```
